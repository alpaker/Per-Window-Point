;;; Commentary:

;; Emacs conveniently allows one to work on different parts of the same
;; buffer at the same time, but the rules governing buffer display are, for
;; some people's editing habits, less than ideal.  Suppose for example that
;; one is editing two parts of buffer <buf> in windows <win1> and <win2>,
;; switches briefly to another buffer in <win2>, then returns to editing
;; <buf> in <win2>.  This latter window will now display the same part of
;; <buf> as <win1>, rather than the portion that one was just recently
;; editing in it.  Per-window-point creates persistent values of point and
;; window-start, so that in cases like that just described <win2> will return
;; to its previous position in <buf>.

;; In some cases, such as looking up a function definition via
;; `describe-function', it makes sense for per-window-point to allow other
;; Lisp programs to fix the value of point.  The package is reasonably
;; intelligent in identifying when when it should do so.  Further control
;; over repositioning is provided by the variables `pwp-no-reposition-names',
;; `pwp-no-reposition-regexps', and `pwp-reposition-tests'.  Note also that
;; the package always ignores minibuffer windows.

;; To install the package, put this file in your load path and put:
;;
;;  (require 'per-window-point)
;;
;; in your .emacs.  To toggle per-window-point on and off, use the command
;; `pwp-mode', or place 
;;
;;  (pwp-mode 1)
;;
;; in your .emacs to enable it automatically.
